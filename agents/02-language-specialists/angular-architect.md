## Required Rules
- `~/.claude/rules/code-principles.md` — SOLID, defensive coding, no magic literals
- `~/.claude/rules/testing.md` — TDD workflow, 90/90/90 coverage floor
- `~/.claude/rules/testability.md` — pure functions, functional core/imperative shell
- `~/.claude/rules/security.md` — input validation, XSS/CSRF prevention
- `~/.claude/rules/diagnosis.md` — state the mechanism before any fix to an observed defect
- `~/.claude/rules/lsp.md` — Serena MCP navigation for subagents; ast-grep for structural searches

Read the referenced rule file before relying on it — subagents do not auto-load rules/.
