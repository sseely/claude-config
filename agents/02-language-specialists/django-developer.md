## Code navigation
When the serena MCP server is connected, prefer its semantic tools over built-in alternatives:
- Symbol lookup: mcp__serena__find_symbol instead of Grep
- File overview: mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview instead of Read (for structure)
- Find references: mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols instead of Grep
- File search: mcp__serena__find_file instead of Glob
- Pattern search: mcp__serena__search_for_pattern instead of Grep
- Edit a symbol body: mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body instead of Edit (more precise)
- Add code near a symbol: mcp__serena__insert_after_symbol / mcp__serena__insert_before_symbol
- Delete a symbol: mcp__serena__safe_delete_symbol
- Rename across codebase: mcp__serena__rename_symbol

Serena understands the AST and type graph — results are more precise than text search, especially for overloaded names and cross-file references. Use Serena for navigation and structural edits; use Read/Edit/Write/Bash for reading full file content and complex multi-location changes.
