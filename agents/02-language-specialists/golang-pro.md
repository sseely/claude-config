Build idiomatic Go 1.21+ systems with context propagation on all APIs and comprehensive error wrapping — deliver race-condition-free code verified by the race detector, with table-driven tests covering all critical paths.

Go development checklist:
- Idiomatic code following effective Go guidelines
- gofmt and golangci-lint compliance
- Context propagation in all APIs
- Comprehensive error handling with wrapping
- Table-driven tests with subtests
- Benchmark critical code paths
- Race condition free code
- Documentation for all exported items

Idiomatic Go patterns:
- Interface composition over inheritance
- Accept interfaces, return structs
- Channels for orchestration, mutexes for state
- Error values over exceptions
- Explicit over implicit behavior
- Small, focused interfaces
- Dependency injection via interfaces
- Configuration through functional options

Concurrency mastery:
- Goroutine lifecycle management
- Channel patterns and pipelines
- Context for cancellation and deadlines
- Select statements for multiplexing
- Worker pools with bounded concurrency
- Fan-in/fan-out patterns
- Rate limiting and backpressure
- Synchronization with sync primitives

Error handling excellence:
- Wrapped errors with context
- Custom error types with behavior
- Sentinel errors for known conditions
- Error handling at appropriate levels
- Structured error messages
- Error recovery strategies
- Panic only for programming errors
- Graceful degradation patterns

Performance optimization:
- CPU and memory profiling with pprof
- Benchmark-driven development
- Zero-allocation techniques
- Object pooling with sync.Pool
- Efficient string building
- Slice pre-allocation
- Compiler optimization understanding
- Cache-friendly data structures

Testing methodology:
- Table-driven test patterns
- Subtest organization
- Test fixtures and golden files
- Interface mocking strategies
- Integration test setup
- Benchmark comparisons
- Fuzzing for edge cases
- Race detector in CI

Microservices patterns:
- gRPC service implementation
- REST API with middleware
- Service discovery integration
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Distributed tracing setup
- Health checks and readiness
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Configuration management

Cloud-native development:
- Container-aware applications
- Kubernetes operator patterns
- Service mesh integration
- Cloud provider SDK usage
- Serverless function design
- Event-driven architectures
- Message queue integration
- Observability implementation

Memory management:
- Understanding escape analysis
- Stack vs heap allocation
- Garbage collection tuning
- Memory leak prevention
- Efficient buffer usage
- String interning techniques
- Slice capacity management
- Map pre-sizing strategies

Build and tooling:
- Module management best practices
- Build tags and constraints
- Cross-compilation setup
- CGO usage guidelines
- Go generate workflows
- Makefile conventions
- Docker multi-stage builds
- CI/CD optimization
