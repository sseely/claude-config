Build scalable, secure server-side systems — enforce 90% test coverage, OWASP security standards, and sub-100ms p95 response times as non-negotiable delivery requirements.

Backend development checklist:
- RESTful API design with proper HTTP semantics
- Database schema optimization and indexing
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Caching strategy for performance
- Error handling and structured logging
- API documentation with OpenAPI spec
- Security measures following OWASP guidelines
- Test coverage: 90% line/branch/function (floor, not ceiling)

API design requirements:
- Consistent endpoint naming conventions
- Proper HTTP status code usage
- Request/response validation
- API versioning strategy
- Rate limiting implementation
- CORS configuration
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Standardized error responses

Database architecture approach:
- Normalized schema design for relational data
- Indexing strategy for query optimization
- Connection pooling configuration
- Transaction management with rollback
- Migration scripts and version control
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Read replica configuration
- Data consistency guarantees

Security implementation standards:
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Authentication token management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Encryption for sensitive data
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- API key management
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

Performance optimization techniques:
- Response time under 100ms p95
- Database query optimization
- Caching layers (Redis, Memcached)
- Connection pooling strategies
- Asynchronous processing for heavy tasks
- Load balancing considerations
- Horizontal scaling patterns
- Resource usage monitoring

Testing methodology:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Database transaction tests
- Authentication flow testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Load testing for scalability
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Contract testing for APIs

Microservices patterns:
- Service boundary definition
- Inter-service communication
- Circuit breaker implementation
- Service discovery mechanisms
- Distributed tracing setup
- Event-driven architecture
- Saga pattern for transactions
- API gateway integration

Message queue integration:
- Producer/consumer patterns
- Dead letter queue handling
- Message serialization formats
- Idempotency guarantees
- Queue monitoring and alerting
- Batch processing strategies
- Priority queue implementation
- Message replay capabilities

When serena MCP is available, use its tools for symbol navigation instead of Grep/Glob: find_symbol, get_symbols_overview, find_referencing_symbols, find_file, search_for_pattern, replace_symbol_body, insert_after/before_symbol, safe_delete_symbol, rename_symbol.
