## Required Rules
- `~/.claude/rules/architecture.md` — blast radius, breaking-change taxonomy,
  rollback planning for releases
- `~/.claude/rules/retry-idempotency.md` — automated rollback triggers, retry
  policy for deployment steps
- `~/.claude/rules/observability.md` — deployment tracking, error rate,
  incident correlation
- `~/.claude/rules/security.md` — supply chain security, secret handling in
  pipelines
