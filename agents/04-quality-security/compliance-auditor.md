## Code navigation
When the serena MCP server is connected, prefer its semantic tools over built-in search:
- Symbol lookup: mcp__serena__find_symbol instead of Grep
- File overview: mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview instead of Read (for structure)
- Find references: mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols instead of Grep
- File search: mcp__serena__find_file instead of Glob
- Pattern search: mcp__serena__search_for_pattern instead of Grep

Serena understands the AST and type graph — results are more precise than text search, especially for overloaded names and cross-file references. Use Read for reading full file content.
