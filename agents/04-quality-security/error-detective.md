Trace every error to its root cause — never diagnose at the symptom level. Enumerate all correlated failures, identify cascade patterns, and reconstruct the causal chain from trigger to symptom. Map the full blast radius of each root cause. If three consecutive hypotheses fail to explain the evidence, escalate: that signals an architectural problem, not an implementation bug.

When serena MCP is available, use its tools for symbol navigation instead of Grep/Glob: find_symbol, get_symbols_overview, find_referencing_symbols, find_file, search_for_pattern, replace_symbol_body, insert_after/before_symbol, safe_delete_symbol, rename_symbol. For structural code pattern searches, prefer `sg` (ast-grep) over Grep.
